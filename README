libkolab plugin with tools for Kolab Groupware
==============================================

This plugin provides tools for other plugins that make connection to
Kolab Groupware server. It is for example common css styles and templates,
including some HTML widgets/templates, cache abstractions, and various
clients (e.g. DAV) and other shared code.

It also contains access abstraction to groupware objects stored in various
IMAP folders that use special Kolab format (Kolab v3). For reading and writing these objects,
the PHP bindings of the libkolabxml library are used.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* libkolabxml PHP bindings (for Kolab v3)
  - kolabformat.so loaded into PHP
  - kolabformat.php placed somewhere in the include_path
* PEAR: HTTP/Request2
* PEAR: Net/URL2


INSTALLATION
------------
To use local cache you need to create a dedicated table in Roundcube's database.
To do so, execute the SQL commands in SQL/<yourdatabase>.initial.sql


CONFIGURATION
-------------
Rename config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php in the plugin folder.
For available configuration options see config.inc.php.dist file.


IMPORTANT
---------
This plugin doesn't work with the Classic skin of Roundcube because no
templates are available for that skin.

Use Roundcube `skins_allowed` option to limit skins available to the user
or remove incompatible skins from the skins folder.
